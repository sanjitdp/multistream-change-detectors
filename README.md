# multistream-change-detectors
This repository contains code implementing the e-d-BH, e-d-Bonferroni, and e-d-Holm algorithms for multi-stream change detection. We empirically verify that these algorithms control the inverse patience weighted rates (IPWR), provide universal control over Type I error, and analyze their detection delay.
